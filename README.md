# Image Classification with CNN and MLP

This repository contains experiments with **Deep Learning models** using Keras/TensorFlow for binary image classification. Two architectures are implemented:

1. **MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron)** with fully connected dense layers  
2. **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)** with convolution, pooling, and data augmentation
